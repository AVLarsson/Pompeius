## Pompeius

A Puzzle game we made, as a schoolproject, using typescript and the p5 library. Pictures are randomly picked and sliced that the player must stop within a frame. You are greated with a main menu were you have to type a username and pick an avatar. Your name is later displayed besides the game and in a highscore-table when the game is over. The "slices" moves diagonally across the screen. On each level the number of slices increases, and so does the speed. You have 3 lives, if you lose all lives the game ends.
